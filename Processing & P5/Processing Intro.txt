8.0 What is an Object Oriented Programming

	• Class is a template or a blueprint
	• Object is the instance.

8.1 Defining a Class Part I

	• Declaring Syntax : Bubble b ; >> similar  to the >> int x;
           [type] [name] ;
	• Object are with the caps letter
	• Calling Object Syntax::  b.display () ; 
	• Initialize :: just like x = 10;     >>  b = new Bubble ();   // Calling the Constructor
	
8.2 A Class Definition

Syntax :: class Bubble { 
[data]
[function]    // both in harmony
}                     //Defining a class
	• Passing Argument Through Constructor 8 min
	• Syntax for constructor inside Class :: Bubble ()     { initialize the x & y value }
	
8.3 Constructor Arguments

Arguments are local to the function
Pass multiple parameters

8.4 Second Constructor

	• Overloading means defining the second or many constructor inside the class.
	• EG:: fill(r, g, b); >> fill(r, g); >> fill (b, alpha);
	• Many Different Versions of a Constructor can be Designed.

	• 10:40 min :: boolean function_name ();          ///
	
	• 6 min :: if ( p1.overlaps( p2) ) {  --code of block--  }
	• Inside class :: boolean overlaps (Particle other) {  --code of block-- }
	
	 
8.5 Pass by value vs Pass by reference

	• Normal data passing through the function just makes the copy of it.
	• BUT, when you pass an object via a function, your are passing the original ref. of the object in the memory.
