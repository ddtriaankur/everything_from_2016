JAVA SCRIPT

	• JavaScript has while loops and do-while loops. 
	The first is good for basic looping; 
	the second for loops where you wish to ensure that the body of the loop is executed at least once

	• JavaScript has a ternary operator for conditional expressions:
	var allowed = (age > 18) ? "yes" : "no";

	• The switch statement can be used for multiple branches based on a number or string:

Objects 
JavaScript objects can be thought of as simple collections of name-value pairs. As such, they are similar to:

	• Dictionaries in Python.
	• Hashes in Perl and Ruby.
	• Hash tables in C and C++.
	• HashMaps in Java.
	• Associative arrays in PHP.
	Everything in JavaScript is an Object
	
	There are two basics ways to create an empty object
	• var obj = new Object()
	• var obj = { }    // Also called as object literal syntax
	• // this syntax is also core of JSON format and should be preferred at all times
	• var obj = {
	name: "carrot" ,
	"for": "Max",
	details: {
		color: "orange"
		size: 12
		   }
	}
	• Attributes can be chained together ::
	Obj.details.color;             //orange
	Obj.['details']['size'];     //12
	
	• Object Prototype
	function Person (name, age){
	This.name = name;
	This.age = age;
	}
// Define an object with constructor
new Person("YOu", 23);

	• Accessing objects properties preferred way
	obj['name'] = 'Simon';
	Var name = obj['name'];
