Sketch & Toons
	think about each line type created being given its own layer (internally this is exactly what happens). 
	When Sketch and Toon creates lines for an object, a new layer is created and the line types inserted.

If Combine is enabled, all line types that can be merged are placed onto the same layer. 
If Combine is disabled, each line type is placed onto its own layer.

Combine
	The following line types will always be created on their own layer: Motion, Particle, Spline, Isoparm, Material alpha map lines.
	
Line Material
Default Visible
	Use the Default Visible and Default Hidden boxes to specify which Sketch material to use for visible lines and which to use for hidden lines (Drag & drop the materials from the Material Manager into the boxes). Leaving a box blank means those lines will not be rendered.

Strokes
	In general, enable strokes when you want to apply an effect over multiple line segments; otherwise, leave strokes disabled. Note that if this option is disabled, artefacting can occur at the beginning or end of individual line segments (but rendering will be faster).
 
 Close Path 
	if enabled, Sketch and Toon will try to join the start and end of the stroke.

Match 
	Although the lines generated by Sketch and Toon come from a 3D scene, the lines themselves are only 2D because they are drawn flat onto the screen. This means you can get line segments that overlap on the screen and could be connected that are actually from different depths of the scene. These settings tell Sketch and Toon how to deal with such line segments. You can set Match to the following modes.

Flat
	ignores the Z-depth and treats all lines as purely 2D;

Sketch Mat
Color Illumination : Illuminate material col according to the light
