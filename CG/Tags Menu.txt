Cinema 4D Tags

Align to Spline Expression
	- If you want to define an animation path for an object,
	- It is recommended first you create the path as Spline object.
	- This has an advantage over the keyframe method in that you can create BSpline paths and use tools such as the magnet.
	- You can also use closed splines for creating cyclic motion a difficult task using keyframes
	
Motion Blur
	- can be use to apply motion blur to an object.
	- Only works in conjuction with the enabled Vector Motion Blur option (and only when rendering in the Picture Viewer).
	- Use in conjunction with the Physical Renderer's motion blur, to define if an object should be rendered with motion blur.
	
Metaball Tag
	- Can be assign to the children of a Metabll Object for further control if the metaball mesh

Subdivision Surface Weight
	- It stores weighting information. It is created automatically when you weight a Subdivision Surface.
	- The subdivision of the objects beneath a Subdivision Surface in the hierarchy can also be controlled.
	- Assign a separate tag to each object.  

Vibrate Expression
	- Used to make objects vary in size, position and rotation in regular patterns (Regular Pulse enabled) or to generate random size, position and rotation changes, making the object vibrate
