Pixel Units
	
	Absolute Pixels : This is real pixels, i.e. 1 unit refers to 1 pixel in the image.
	Relative Pixels : these values are all scaled relative to the object's bound.
		- this means that 1 pixel thickness may change based on the objeect's size;
		- this is sceen size of the object
		- what matters is the size of the object rendered onto the screen. 
	World Space :: The pixels are transformed from the world space,
		- so a pixel is smaller the further away it is from the camera

Clip Strokes to Screen
	- This controls how ht lines are clipped
	- if part of the object is off screen.

Self Blend
	- sometimes it's useful to render the same line multiple times with different materials.
	- to assign multiple Sketch materials to the same object, simply add a Sketch Style  tag for each material.
	- this settings define the blending mode for lines on hte same object
Blend 
	- The blend mode sets the Mode for Lines of other objects.
	
Blend Modes
	- Average :: the result of the background and blend pixel.
	- Normal :: blend overwrites the background pixel
	- Screen :: opposite of Multiply. Both pixels get inverted, multiplied then inverted again.
	- Darken :: whichever is the darker is shown above.
	- Lighten :: opposite of Darken.
	- Difference :: background and blend pixels are subtracted from each other.
	- Negative :: same as Difference mode except color between white and black become brighter instead of darken.
	- Exclusion :: same as Difference except it creates a softer effect.
	- Overlay :: combination of Screen and Multiply mode, depending on the background color.

	- Hard Light :: 50% is neutral. Lighter values act like Screen, darker values act like multiply.
	- Soft Light :: Dodge mode for blend pixel values above 50%, Burn mode for values below 50%.
	- Dodge, Burn :: brightness value of the blend pixel is used to brighten or darken the backgound pixel.
	- Reflect :: 
	- Stamp :: mid nothing. brighter and darker do the resp. thing
	- Levr :: value of blend pixel is used to apply contrast to the background pixel.


HATCH SHADER
	- sketch and Toon's most advanced shader.
	- It places a picture of a stroke (or any other picture) multiple times onto the object to create a hatched lines effect
	- give you full control over how these strokes are placed,
	- making it possible for you to create any type of hatched lines effect. 

Texture
	- in general use an image of a stroke or strokes as the textures.
	- to be use as the stoke //used only the greyscale
Color
	- here you can choose the color of the strokes. 
	- It can draw two types of stroke:dark strokes and light strokes.
