Projection
	- The offset & Length setting define the position and size of the texture in the X and Y directions on the texture envelope.
	- For example, if Length X and Y are both set to  100%, the texture covers the envelope completely.

Spherical
	- Spherical mapping projects the texture onto the objects in a spherical form.
	- Rarely suitable for flat objects. 
	- There is distortion with cylindrical objects also.
Cylindrical
	- Projects the texture onto the object in a cylindrical shape.
	- Rarely suitable for flat objects.
	- Distorted when used with spherical objects
Flat
	- Flat mapping projects the texture onto the object in a planar direction.
	- Flat projection tends to be used with flat objects only.
	- Gets distorted when applied to a sphere or cylinder.
Cubic
	-  Cubic mapping projects the texture onto all six sides of a texture cube.
Frontal
	- Projected from the camera position onto the object. 
	- You can create various visual effects using Frontal mapping, 
	- Or perform compositing tricks directly in C4D.
	- Seen in science fiction films where characters or spaceships gradually blend into the background using cloaking.
	- Use Frontal mapping for such effects.
	- Another interesting effect, remove the Background object and move the polygon around!
Spatial
	- Spatial mapping is similar to Flat projection.
	- However, the texture is pulled up and to the left as it passes through the object.
	- Does cause some distortion and as such is not suitable for photographic images.
	- Spatial mapping is more suitable for structural textures, such as plaster and marble.

UVW Mapping
	- If an object has UVW coordinates, you can select them as projection type.
	- In this case, the texture geometry is fixed to the object surface & is subject to all subsequent movement & deformation applied to the object.

	- UV projection is explained in the UV Edit menu.
	- Primitive and Generative objects have UVW mapping applied to them by default.
	- All Polygon objects with UVW coordinates have a UVW tag in the Object Manager.
What's the third coordinate for

Shrink Wrapping
	- With this type the centre of the texture is fixed to the north pole of a sphere and the rest of the texture is stretched over it.
	- The advantage of this mapping type is that the texture meets itself at the south pole only.
Camera Mapping
	- The texture is projected from the camera onto the object.
	- Tip:: Camera mapping has its own Manager, Projection Man, which offers all the other options.
