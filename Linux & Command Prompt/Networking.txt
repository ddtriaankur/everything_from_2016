A file descriptor is simply an integer associated with an open file.

Two Types of Internet Sockets
Raw sockets look them up
	- Stream Socket and 
	- Datagram Sockets  reff to as SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM
	Sometimes called as connectionless sockets

STREAM SOCKET :: telnet ??
	• http uses the stream socket 
	• data arrives in the order
	• TCP 'Transmission control protocol' 


DATAGRAM SOCKETS :: packets may arrive in order
	•  the data within the packets will be error free
	• UDP 'User Datagram Protocol' also uses IP
	• Why are connectionless
	• For ex. Tftp(trivial file transfer protocol pg 5) the recipient has to sent back a I got it package
	ie. An ACK package [Acknowledgement procedure]
	• UDP is good for speed and speed

Low level Nonsense and Network Theory

Data Encapsulation :: 
	• Ethernet >> IP >> UDP >> TFTP >> DATA
	• When the another computer recieves the packet 
	• The hardware strips the Ethernet header
	• The kernel strips the IP and UDP header
	• The TFTP program strips the TFTP header, and it finally has the data
	• Layered Network Models !!?
	• Layers of the full blown model ::
	- Application - Presentation - Session - Transport - Network - Data Link - Physical
	• Physical layer is the hardware (serial Ethernet etc)
	
	UNIX might be :: 
	Application Layer (telnet, ftp etc)
	Host to Host Transport Layer (TCP, UDP)
	Internet Layer (IP and routing)
	Network Access Later (Ethernet, wifi or wahtever )
