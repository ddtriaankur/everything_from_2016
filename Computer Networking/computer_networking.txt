Modem its a device that connects you to the internet. Converts digital signal to analog signals
DOCSIS	 3.0 modem version 

Wifi\ Router   they joins two network together
Switch  gives more port .. managed and unmanaged

Repeater  boost signals
Ethernet  100m signals looses. switches and router they both can act as a switch
